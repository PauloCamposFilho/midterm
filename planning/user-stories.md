# User Stories

## CORE
As a user (registered or not), I can see the list of available maps and select a particular map to view because I want to learn about interesting features of a part of the world.

As an authenticated user, I can create maps that point out interesting information in an area because I’d like to share this information with others, and to save it for myself for future reference.

As an authenticated user I can change that I’ve made, because I’m always learning new things about the features of the world that I’m interested in and I want to keep my maps up to date.

As a user I can favourite because I want to keep track of interesting maps while showing to other things that I might be interested in.

As a user, I can have a profile showcasing my favourite maps and maps that I’ve contributed to because I want to share that information with others.

As an authenticated user, I can help improve other authenticated user's maps, and them my own, because I want us to have the best available information.

## STRETCH
(As a user I can search for maps around me because I want to find maps that are most relevant to me.)
